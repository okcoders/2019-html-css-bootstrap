# Hello World

To be a good programmer you must learn to be ok with not knowing. Not knowing how to solve a problem, not knowing the next step, not knowing a particular term. You must also know when to ask someone something, vs. when to look it up online yourself. 

Today we will be spending some time flexing the not knowing muscle, by looking up and learning as much as we can on our own about some core programming concepts.
