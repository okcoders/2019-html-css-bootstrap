Preclass Preparation
You will need to install a few applications on your computer for this course and set up what's called your "development environment."

Instructions are provided for Linux, Macintosh, and Windows computers, the operating systems supported by this course material. If you are not familiar with the command line, expect to spend a couple hours on this.
