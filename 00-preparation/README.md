<h1>Preclass Preparation</h1>

You only need three applications to get started with this course
- a development/coding tool called [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- the google chrome web [browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
- [slack](https://slack.com/downloads), so we can communicate in and outside of class

Go to the three links provided above to install. During the first class we will get your email to invite you to slack

If you already have a preferred text/coding tool (sublime text, atom, etc.) and a preferred browser (firefox, safari, etc.) that is fine, and you can use those during the course, but do keep in mind that the instructor will be using the above, and it is usually easier to follow along if you are using the same toolkit.

If you have any problems with the above that is fine, during the first class we can help you out.
