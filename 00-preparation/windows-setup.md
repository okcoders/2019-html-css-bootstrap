## Install software

Install the following software by downloading it at these urls:

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/chrome/browser/).

We will be doing all web development in Google Chrome because of its excellent developer tools.

Windows does come with a built-in command prompt, but we will be using another Terminal emulator with built-in support for git, the version control software that works with GitHub. *Do not use the built-in command prompt*. Use Git Bash.

Nice work! You just set up your development environment and are already using the command line! This is serious stuff!
